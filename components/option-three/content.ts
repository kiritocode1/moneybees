  },
  {
    q: "How is risk managed?",
    a: "Before capital is committed, not after. Business quality filters, valuation discipline, position sizing, and balance-sheet strength all sit ahead of the buy decision, and every holding is reviewed against the thesis that justified it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often will I hear from the team?",
    a: "Monthly statements, quarterly reviews, and a written note whenever something material changes. When a thesis breaks you hear it from us, in plain language, before you read it in the price.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens in a bad year?",
